              The Video Computing Group at UC Riverside conducts cutting edge research in computer vision, image processing, pattern recognition, statistical learning, and statistical processing.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Current projects are related to camera networks, human activity recognition and recognition, and bioimage analysis. The work provides the scientific underpinning behind applications capable of automated/semi-automated analysis of the 3D environment from images/videos, analogous to capabilities of biological visual systems. Members of the group regularly publish in top-tier conferences and journals in computer vision and image processing. Past members work in major research labs and hold faculty positions across the world.
