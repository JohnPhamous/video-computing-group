                    Dr. Roy-Chowdhury leads the Video Computing Group at UCR, with research interests in computer vision/image processing, pattern recognition, and statistical signal processing. His group is involved in research projects related to camera networks, human behavior modeling, face recognition, and bioimage analysis. Application domains include national and homeland security, commercial multimedia, home infrastructure, computational biology, and digital arts. The underlying approach of his research is to harness various methods in systems theory, signal processing, machine learning, mathematics and statistics to the analysis of images and videos in order to obtain an understanding of their content. This scientific understanding can lead to machine vision technologies that can provide an automated/semi-automated analysis of the 3D environment from images/videos, analogous to the capabilities of biological visual systems. Prof. Roy-Chowdhury's research has been supported by various agencies including the National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research, Army Research Office, DARPA, National Endowment for the Humanities, and private industries like CISCO and Lockheed-Martin. His recent book on Camera Networks, the first monograph on the topic, provides an overview of current research in the field. For more details, please see his CV.
